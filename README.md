# SGI STandard Template Library (STL)

This is a git archive of the SGI Standard Template Library source code and
documentation.  This was at one time available on SGI and Hewlett-Packard
websites.  It is currently (as of 2022-09) available on
[rrsd.com](http://www.rrsd.com).  I created this git repo two reasons:

1. So it is easier to browse through the code using git based tools.
2. For posterity, in case [rrsd.com](http://www.rrsd.com) goes away.

The links from `rrsd.com` that work as I write this are:

1. http://www.rrsd.com/software_development/stl/index.htm
